# MediSure üöëüíä

**MediSure** is a Flask-based web service designed to assist pharmacists and healthcare professionals.  
It provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing prescriptions, retrieving drug information, validating prescriptions, checking drug interactions, and searching for drugs or conditions.  

This implementation leverages **Hugging Face‚Äôs LLaMA model** for natural language understanding, enabling flexible, local AI processing without reliance on OpenAI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
To set up medisure on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Authenticate with Hugging Face

    Login via CLI:

    huggingface-cli login
    ``
5. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

The web interface provides easy access to upload prescriptions and input text for analysis. The API also provides several endpoints:

- `POST /upload_and_process_image`: Uploads a prescription image for text extraction and processing.
- `POST /analyze_prescription`: Analyzes the given prescription text.
- `POST /get_drug_information`: Retrieves information for a specified drug.
- `POST /validate_prescription`: Validates the given prescription text.
- `POST /check_drug_interactions`: Checks for interactions between a list of drugs.
- `POST /search_drug_or_condition`: Searches for information on a drug or medical condition.

When uploading a prescription image, the service uses OCR technology to extract the text and then leverages AI to preprocess this text, ensuring that it is clear and structured, ready for further analysis.
